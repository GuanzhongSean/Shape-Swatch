# Shape Swatch

Shape Swatch is a project with two implementations for managing and interacting with a collection of shapes. Users can add shapes to a list, select them for editing or deletion, and modify their properties. The project supports four types of shapes, each with customizable properties.

## Implementations

This project is implemented in two ways:

- **Vanilla (Vite Vanilla-TS Template)**: Utilizes plain TypeScript without any framework to handle the UI logic and rendering.
- **Preact (Vite Preact TSX Template)**: Employs Preact, a fast 3kB alternative to React, using TSX for templating and Tailwind for CSS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to manage dependencies and run the project.

### Usage

```
cd vanilla  # or 'cd preact'
npm install
npm run dev
```
